# DeliveryApp
## Android App Project
In 2023 Fall semester one of the courses I took was Android development.
The app created as my final course project.

## App's idea: 
#### The app's idea is to track orders and get their status (shipment details, product ordered, date of order and more).

#### App's activities:

* ##### Main screen - Where you can see list of your orders and below the list you can find a search bar, order add button and order delete button.
* ##### Order screen - This screen pops up when you click on an order from the main screen and contains a short summary of your order along side order details button, shipment details button and edit order button.
* ##### Order Details screen - In this screen you can find details about the selected order such as product's name, order date and much more.
* ##### Shipment Details screen - In this screen, similar to 'Order Details screen' you can find details about selected order's shipment.
* ##### Add Order screen - A screen with EditText fields where you can place a new order using your desired details.
* ##### Edit Order screen - A screen with EditText fields already filled with selected order details where you can edit the data you want.
