# DeliveryApp
## Android App Project
In 2023 Fall semester one of the courses I took was Android development.
The app created as my final course project.

## App's idea:
#### The app's idea is to track orders and get their status (shipment details, product ordered, date of order and more).

#### App's activities:

* ##### Main screen - Where you can see list of your orders and below the list you can find a search bar and order creation button.
* ##### Edit screen - This screen pops up when you click on an order from the main screen's RecyclerView and contains some EditText fields filled with chosen order field data along side order details button, shipment details button, order delete button and edit order button (the edit order button is there to confirm changes made in the app).
* ##### Order Details screen - In this screen you can find details about the selected order such as product's name, order date and much more.
* ##### Shipment Details screen - In this screen, similar to 'Order Details screen' you can find details about selected order's shipment.
* ##### Add Order screen - A screen with EditText fields where you can place a new order using your desired details.

## Side Notes:
Since the app isn't linked to any third side such as shipment company or a supplier, some of the data that needs to be update by the supplier's side is hard coded.
You can find some DB manipulations that can help implement supplier's side data in the future (such as open order and close order).

feel free to follow!
